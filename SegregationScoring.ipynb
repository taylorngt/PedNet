scoring metrics are unhelpful for classification according to margin maximization efforts\n","*   Changes to betweeness scoring to work off affected and carrier subgraph greatly improved scoring (including mode dependent scoring)\n","*   Fraction based optimization showing the faults in margin based optimization (maybe need to work off of something other than average of margin, add additional boolean gate??)\n","    *  Fraction based optimization does not seem to be acutalually varying the weights and sticking with defaults.\n","      * turns out this is because the fraction is not a smooth function and has large plataues, the minimization function relies on this function being smooth and coninuous with a clear gradient for minimzation\n","    *  Should try penalizing the cases where the incorrect varient recieves the highest score (-1 penality to average margin?) where correctly scored variants have normal margin calculation\n","      * adjusted the fraction optimization to have -0.5 penalty when incorrectly scored (working to mixed results, both optimization techniques range wildly in their efficacy)\n","    *  Optimized weights are consistently under performing compared to default weights for AR scoring, extended scoring providing some benefit (currently doing additive 1.5 bonus for margins that are correctly scored in fraction optimization)\n","    * Initall guesses for optimization were adjusted to be equal to the initial guesses given when foregoing optimization given the defaults were opten out performing defaults in accuracy\n","*   Added testing/training split for cases of weight optimization\n","*   Adjusted betweeness scores:\n","    * network X normalizes scores by default\n","    * previous was scoring carrier betweeness by doing average carrier normalized score for carrier+affected subgraph\n","    * trialed doing subgraph betweeness(avg)/complete betweeness(avg) with both scores being the normalized scores: this resulted in many score values > 1\n","    * tried same scoring metric without normalization: worked well, many scores went to default 0 or 1 but work towards the trends we want for scoring\n","*   Rank Optimization\n","    * Fraction optimization wasn't providing any additional performance over margin optimization (makes sense since I was just basically doing a varied margin optimization, trying to add additional punishment for negative margins)\n","    * Tried new technique that incoorperates where the linked variant score ranks among the other unlinked varient score\n","    * Then multiply that rank by the margin (negative if rank > 1 and positive if rank = 1) adding scaling punshiment for poorly ranking linked variant scores\n","    * In my head, this helps us prioritize correct score rank while maintianing margin increase as a secondary objective (while maintaining a smooth minimization function thanks to margin)\n","    * Overall minimization is done on the averaged ranked_margin values subtracted from the optimal score (max margin (i.e. 1)  x number of variants)\n","        * why am I multiplying the max margin by the number of variants?? the optimal score for the averaged ranked margin would just be 1 right? since the correct variant scoring would result in a rank of 1 and the the highest margin we can expect would be 1 (then the average ranked_margin of a perfectly marked variant would 1?)\n","*   Scoring Performance Notes:\n","    * Scoring working very well for pedigrees with roughly 10 variants, generation ranging 3-5 (accuracy between 0.9 and 1.0 for all optimization techniques, **FIGURE 1**)\n","    * Increasing the number of variants in vartable severely decreases scoring performance (100 variants reduces accuracy to around 0.7-0.9, **FIGURE 2**)\n","    * Changing the initial guess for weight optimization to default weights used when not optimizing (did this because unoptimized was consistently outperforming optimized weightings): results were neutral with little to no increase in optimization perfmance; will try to adjust optimization methods\n","    * New Ranked Margin Optimization (described above) appears to greatly improve optimization performance (**Figure 4**)\n","      * Testing of new ranked ranking system also appears to improve scoring performance across pedigree size (**Figure 5**)\n","\n","* Computational Performance\n","    * adjusted scoring such that categorical scores only need to calculated once (stored as dictionary within pedigree group data dict) and only need to calculate weighted score using these categorical scores and adjusted weights when optimizing\n","    * This adjustment greatly improved runtime!
